## Syntax and Semantics

### Quotations & Anti-quotations

#### Identifiers

```coq
@x = ident:(x)

&x
  = hyp @x (in ltac2 expressions)
  = ltac2:(Control.refine (fun () => hyp @x)) (in constrs)
```

#### Constrs / Terms

```coq
'term = open_constr:(term)
```

#### Anti-quotation

```coq
$x = ltac2:(Control.refine (fun () => x)) (with x : constr)
```

An extra [explanation](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67367231/what-does-control-refine-do-in-ltac2)
for anti-quotation semantics.

> ... the semantics of the quotation is to evaluate its content inside a goal
> Γ ⊢ A where Γ is the current list of hypotheses, and A the inferred type of the hole.
> ...
> This is precisely the role of `Control.refine : (unit -> constr) -> unit`.
> It takes a (for technical reasons, thunked) term as an argument and uses it
> to solve the goal(s) under focus.

## Notations

### Syntactic Classes

```coq
tactic(n) where n = 0 .. 6
```

- `n = 0`: atoms, parenthesized expression, list / record / unit literals
- `n = 1`: function application, record field access (?)
- `n = 2`: list cons
- `n = 3`: comma expression (?)
- `n = 4`:
- `n = 5`: let binding, lambda expression
- `n = 6`: tactic sequence (`;` expression)
